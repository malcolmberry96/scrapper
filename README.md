# Scrapper

News scrapping application that takes the top articles from the Verge - Tech and allows the user to comment on them. This application uses MongoDB as database management and Mongoose as the ORM. To do the actual work of scraping, the npm package "cheerio" was used. 

The home page is where the user will be able to scrape articles on The Verge - Tech by hitting the "Scrape" button in the navbar.

Once a user selects "Read Article" they are rediricted to the article page where they can skim through a sample of the article and make a comment on it. The user's comment will then be displayed at the bottom of the screen in a comments section.
